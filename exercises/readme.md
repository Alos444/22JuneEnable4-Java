### Operators

#### Calculator

In the `exercises.beginner.operators` package, implement the following in the `Calculator` class:
   1. A method which adds two numbers and returns their sum.
   2. A method which subtracts two numbers and returns their difference.
   3. A method which multiplies two numbers and returns their product.
   4. A method which divides two numbers and returns their quotient.

#### Results

In the `exercises.beginner.operators` package, a `Results` class exists for you to do this exercise.

A person takes 3 exams in college, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, each exam has a maximum of 150 marks. When all the exam marks have been added together, we can find the overall percentage that the person has got by multiplying their score by 100 and then dividing by 450.

The `Results` class has been created for you with 5 instance variables already populated. You must implement the following methods:

- `displayResults()`: displays the results that the person got for each exam and then the total mark.

- `displayPercentage()`: which finds and displays the percentage that the person received for the exams overall.

For `displayResults()`, the output to the console must contain the following fragments, they may be in any order:

**Header**

```
###############
# EXAM SCORES #
###############
```

**Body**

```
PHYSICS: 104
CHEMISTRY: 134
BIOLOGY: 97
```

**Footer**

```
TOTAL SCORE: 335/450
PERCENTAGE: 74%
```

For `displayPercentage()`, the output to the console must contain the following:

```
PERCENTAGE: 74%
```

The exam scores and percentages will differ according to the values you use, everything else about the header, body and footer fragments must remain the same.
